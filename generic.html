								<p>After obtaining my bachelors's degree in Spanish, I started my tech career in  Minneapolis in the retail sector. It there that I found my passion for development and data. My roles included providing support to Spanish-speaking clients, providing quantitative and qualitative analysis of data transmission trends and errors, partnering with multiple internal teams and a major retailer, to make a major security transition in communication methods, and onboarding retailers and their product data for our data analytics platform. During my time there, I sharpened my programming skills in Python and C# and utilized SQL extensively to update databases. I also became even more familiar with the Software Development Life Cycle, and was part of weekly releases.</p>
								<p> During the pandemic, I returned to Wisconsin, where I started a Paralegal/Legal Studies program. I completed an internship with the City of Madison's Department of Civil Rights and conducted a quantitative analysis of housing data in New York City and New York State after moving there in 2021. I graduated in May 2025 with a postbaccalaurate certificate. I never forgot my passion for data, and in November 2023, I graduated from a Data Science boot camp by TripleTen, where I used real world problems to explore data analysis, machine learning, and language learning through Python and SQL. I also completed an externship where I used Large Language Models to create a generative AI chatbot to answer customer questions for a client. </p>
								<p>In April of this year, I decided to leverage my years of experience and skill in training and education to start my own SaaS platform to help other businesses train and onboard employees at the department level in order to improve employees' sense of wellbeing in the first 90 days and businesses' overall retention of talent. I currently work a Program Coordinator for a nonprofit as well.  I also volunteer, which allows me to keep my Spanish skills strong. I look forward to the chance to work together in the future. Please find my information on the Contact Information tab to reach out!</p>
