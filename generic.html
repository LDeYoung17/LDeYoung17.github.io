								<p>After obtaining my bachelors's degree in Spanish, I started my career in the tech world in Customer Support. I joined an EDI company, advising customers on data transmission errors and best practices, and troubleshooting connections to retailers and setups between suppliers and retailers. It was in this role that I found my passion for development and data. I then moved into a specialized role that provided analysis of data trends and errors to help customers reduce their mistakes and help them become more savvy in their creation of documents. During this time, I partnered with technology teams on a project to make a major security transition in communication methods. From there, I transitioned to a development team as a Quality Engineer. After about a year of testing Java code that transformed data to a standard format for transmission, I was assigned to a project for retailer onboarding for our data analytics platform.</p>
								<p>During this project, I sharpened my programming skills in Python and C# and utilized SQL extensively to update databases. I also became even more familiar with the Software Development Life Cycle, and was part of weekly releases. It was during this time that I realized that I wanted to explore data analysis further. I took some time to try a graduate program in Linguistics, but found that it was not for me. During the pandemic, I returned to Wisconsin, where I started a Paralegal/Legal Studies program. I then moved to New York, where I have been continuing the program remotely and plan to graduate in May 2024. I also realized that Data Science is a passion of mine, and in November 2023, I graduated from a Data Science boot camp by TripleTen, where I used real world problems to explore data analysis, machine learning, and language learning through Python and SQL. I also completed an externship where I used Large Language Models to create a generative AI chatbot to answer customer questions for a client. Currently I am seeking work in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Data Engineering. I am passionate about fair housing, artificial intelligence, and making meaningful change. I look forward to the chance to work together in the future. Please find my information on the Contact Information tab to reach out!</p>
